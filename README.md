# LocalK8s

This is a local and as lightweight as 2 or more Linux VMs can be for a K8s implementation.
The inspiration came for learning and when offering a training course at the company.

The components have been carefully selected for their "lightweithness" and the only two requirements are
- Multipass and
- an internet connection (be warned, VPNs can cause havoc)

The components used are
1. K3s - the lightweight K8s implementation by Rancher
2. Longhorn - the open source distributed storage CSI driver
